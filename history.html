            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Olympic Games, athletic festival that originated in ancient Greece and was
                revived in the late 19th
                century. Before the 1970s the Games were officially limited to competitors with amateur status, but in
                the 1980s many events were opened to professional athletes. </p>

            <p>The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques)[1][2] are leading international sporting
                events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the
                world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost
                sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.[3] The Olympic Games are normally held
                every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the four-year
                period.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in
                Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the
                International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The
                IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement,[definition needed] with the Olympic Charter defining
                its structure and authority.

                The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes
                to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for
                snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for
                athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and
                Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also
                endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of economic,
                political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations
                prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of
                professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the
                issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the
                cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited
                participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics;[4] and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a
                result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees
                (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC
                is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to
                the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be
                contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and
                torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2016 Summer
                Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics combined, in 35 different sports and over 400 events.[5][6] The first,
                second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze,
                respectively.
