            <h1 style="color:red;">Michael phelps </h1>
            <p>Michael Fred Phelps II (born June 30, 1985)[5] is an American former competitive swimmer. He is the most
                successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[6] with a total of 28 medals.[7] Phelps also holds
                the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[8] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and
                Olympic medals in individual events (16).[9] When Phelps won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing
                Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any
                single Olympic Games. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps already tied the record of eight
                medals of any color at a single Games by winning six gold and two bronze medals. At the 2012 Summer
                Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio
                de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the
                Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[10][11]
            </p>
            <p>
                Phelps is the long course world record holder in the men's 400-meter individual medley as well as the
                former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter
                butterfly, and 200-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course
                competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World
                Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking
                performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the
                Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned
                Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in
                the 2008 Games.

            <p>An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at
                three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). He also won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained
                worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which
                made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory.

                An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100 m, 200 m and 4 × 100 metres
                relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011. He is the most
                successful male athlete of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World
                Championship titles in the 200 m and is one of the most successful in the 100 m with three titles.

                11 medals, she is Australia's most successful Olympian, including one gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics
                in Rio de Janeiro and four golds at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. With four gold and three bronze
                medals she was the most decorated athlete at the 2020 Summer Olympics, and is tied for the most medals
                won in a single Olympics by a woman. In addition McKeon has won four gold, at the World Aquatics
                Championships; and twelve medals, including eight gold, at the 2014 Glasgow and 2018 Gold Coast
                Commonwealth Games.

                She currently has five Olympic gold medals, the most in Australian history, tied with Ian Thorpe.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, McKeon won four gold medals. She swam the third leg of
                the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Australian team, which won the gold medal in a world record
                time of 3:29.69. On the second last day of swimming, she also went to win the 100 metre freestyle in a
                time of 51.96 (an Olympic record and the second fastest time in history). On the last day, she won the
                50 metre freestyle with another Olympic record time of 23.81 and swam the butterfly leg in the
                gold-medal winning team for the 4 × 100 metre medley relay.

                McKeon also won three bronze medals: in the 100 metre butterfly (with a new Australian record of 55.72),
                the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay, and the mixed 4 × 100 metre medley relay.

                McKeon won seven medals in Tokyo, the most by any female swimmer at a single Games and the equal most by
                a female athlete at a single Games (tied with Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya).[11] Her total of five
                Olympic gold medals (across 2016 and 2020) is an Australian record (shared with Ian Thorpe).[12]
