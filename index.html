            <p>Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7
                September
                2013.[2] Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to
                2021
                in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the
                Olympic
                Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[3] However, the event retained the Tokyo
                2020
                name for marketing and branding purposes.[4] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public
                spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in
                response to
                the pandemic.[b] The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days
                after
                the completion of the Olympics.[6]</p>
