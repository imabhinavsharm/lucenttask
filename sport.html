            <h1 style="color:yellow;">About some popular sports </h1>
            <p>The Olympic Games programme consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and 408 events. For example, wrestling
                is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is further broken
                down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight
                class.[155] The Summer Olympics programme includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics programme
                features 15 sports.[156] Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic gymnastics are the only summer
                sports that have never been absent from the Olympic programme. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice
                hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics
                programme since its inception in 1924. Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and
                volleyball, first appeared on the programme as demonstration sports, and were later promoted to full
                Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.

            <h1>Weightlifting </h1>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
                The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk. The snatch is a wide-grip,
                one-move lift. The clean and jerk is a close-grip, two-move lift. Each weightlifter receives three
                attempts in each, and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall
                result within a bodyweight category. Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors
                and change over time. A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful
                clean and jerk also fails to total, and therefore receives an "incomplete" entry for the competition.
                The clean and press was once a competition lift, but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging
                proper form.

            <h1 style="color: green;">Wrestling </h1>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
                Wrestling was a feature of the ancient Olympic Games in 708 BC, with the sport's Greco-Roman style
                included in the first Games of the modern era at Athens 1896. Eight years later, freestyle wrestling was
                introduced at the St. Louis 1904 Games. Women's freestyle wrestling joined the Olympic programme at
                Athens in 2004.

                The essence of both styles is the same: with no equipment and no grasping at clothing, two athletes try
                to press both shoulders of their opponent down onto the mat. Greco-Roman wrestlers use only their upper
                bodies and arms, while freestyle wrestlers can use any part of their body.

                The competition programme at Rio 2016 included six weight categories each for men's Greco-Roman, men's
                freestyle and women's freestyle. For all events, there is a direct elimination system that eventually
                decides the two finalists for the gold medal match. All wrestlers who lose to a finalist are entered
                into the repechage.

            <h1 style="color:red;">Equestrian </h1>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
                Equestrianism made its Summer Olympics debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. It
                disappeared until 1912, but has appeared at every Summer Olympic Games since. The current Olympic
                equestrian disciplines are Dressage, Eventing, and Jumping. In each discipline, both individual and team
                medals are awarded. Women and men compete together on equal terms.

                Equestrian disciplines and the equestrian component of Modern Pentathlon are also the only Olympic
                events that involve animals. The horse is considered as much an athlete as the rider.

                The International Governing Body for equestrian sports is the Fédération Équestre Internationale
                (FEI).[1] The 1924 Olympics were the first at which equestrian competitions were held under the
                authority of the FEI.
